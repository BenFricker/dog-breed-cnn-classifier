</p>

**Top Performing Breeds (F1 > 0.97):**
- Afghan Hound, Keeshond, Saint Bernard achieved perfect classification (F1 = 1.000)
- These breeds have distinctive features: unique coat patterns, clear size differences, distinctive physical characteristics

```

<a id="usage"></a>
## üíª Usage

### Step 1: Download the Dataset

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The dataset is NOT included in this repository due to its size (~750 MB, 20,580 images).

**Option A: Download from Kaggle** (Recommended - Easier)
1. Create a free account at [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com)
2. Go to [Stanford Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset)
3. Click "Download" button
4. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer

**Option B: Download from Stanford** (Original Source)
1. Visit: http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/
2. Download: `Images.tar`
3. Extract to your preferred location

**Expected folder structure after extraction:**
```
your-chosen-location/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Images/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ n02085620-Chihuahua/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ n02085782-Japanese_spaniel/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ n02085936-Maltese_dog/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (117 more breed folders)
```

### Step 2: Configure the Data Path

Open `Dog-Breed-CNN.py` in any text editor and find line 99:

```python
# BEFORE (line 99):
data_dir = r'C:\Users\benwf\OneDrive\Desktop\UOW\UOW\Foundations of Artificial Intelligence\Assessments\Group Project\images'

# AFTER (update to YOUR path):
data_dir = r'C:/Users/YourName/Downloads/Images'  # Windows
# OR
data_dir = '/Users/YourName/Downloads/Images'      # Mac/Linux
```

**üí° Tip:** Use forward slashes `/` or raw strings `r'...'` to avoid path issues.

### Step 3: Run Training

```bash
python Dog-Breed-CNN.py
```

**What happens during training:**
- ‚úÖ Loads and preprocesses 20,580 images
- ‚úÖ Splits data (70% train, 15% validation, 15% test)
- ‚úÖ Trains for 10 epochs (~70 seconds per epoch on GPU)
- ‚úÖ Saves best model as `best_dog_breed_model.pth`
- ‚úÖ Generates training curves and confusion matrices

### Step 4: View Results

After training completes, you'll find these files in your directory:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `best_dog_breed_model.pth` | Trained model checkpoint (best validation accuracy) |
| `training_curves.png` | Loss and accuracy plots over epochs |
| `confusion_matrix_part_1.png` | Confusion matrix (classes 0-29) |
| `confusion_matrix_part_2.png` | Confusion matrix (classes 30-59) |
| `confusion_matrix_part_3.png` | Confusion matrix (classes 60-89) |
| `confusion_matrix_part_4.png` | Confusion matrix (classes 90-119) |

**Console output** will show:
- Training/validation accuracy and loss per epoch
- Final test accuracy (~83%)
- Detailed classification report (precision, recall, F1-score per breed)

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory`
- **Solution:** Check that `data_dir` path is correct and points to the `Images` folder

**Problem:** `CUDA out of memory`
- **Solution:** Reduce `batch_size` from 32 to 16 (line 163 in the code)

**Problem:** Training is very slow
- **Solution:** Ensure you have a CUDA-capable GPU. CPU training will take 10-20x longer.

**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'`
- **Solution:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
